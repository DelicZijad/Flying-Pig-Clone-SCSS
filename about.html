            <h2 class="section__heading font28 weight7 my32 txtCtr">chef john crook</h2>
      <p class="section__para font12">John Crook’s career started out over 20 years ago with a summer job at the Horseshoe Bay Boathouse. He had no idea that
    his start as a dishwasher and prep cook be the beginning of a lifelong education. The restaurant was a smaller operation
    and he was fortunate to work alongside either the Chef or sous chef and be surrounded by the freshest ingredients on a
    daily basis either from local producers or off the boats that docked daily at the front door. Schooled in classic
    techniques pushed him to achieve more every day and the kitchen’s motto was ‘never settle for just good enough’.
    <br>
    <br>
    The following years saw John training all around the world. Having finished his Canadian Red Seal Certificate and
    apprenticeship under one of Canada’s most celebrated chefs, Chef Robert Allen Sulatycky, he moved to New York to master
    the Pastry and Baking Arts. John attended Peters Kump’s Cooking School, where he graduated with honors at the top of his
    class, while simultaneously working full time for world renowned, 3rd generation pastry Chef, Francois Payard. He
    started out as a stagier for Chef Payard and within 3 months was managing his Patisserie 6 days a week. He spent the
    rest of school sprinting from classroom to his real life training in the patisserie … “school can only teach you the
    basics because when you make pastry cream in school it’s for 3 people and in a professional kitchen it’s for 3000! At
    some point the science of pastries changes and you just can’t buy the kind of education you receive on the job.”
    <br>
    <br>
    After working for Payard for 6 months John had the opportunity to work for the world-renowned Thomas Haas, thus ensuring
    that his goal of learning the Art of Pastries was well on its way. Under Haas’ wing, John spent the next 6 months
    working alongside a true master and technician. At some point all good things must come to an end and John’s working
    Visa ran out and he moved back to Vancouver.
    <br>
    <br>
    John next joined the Four Seasons where he worked for the next 5 years studying every aspect of Hotel BOH management.
    His positions ranged from patisserie, pastry sous chef, pastry chef, and restaurant sous chef. Following the dream of
    one day owning his own restaurant John made the leap and began working at various restaurants in Vancouver. It was at
    Joe Fortes where John met his latest mentor…Emad Yacoub. Taking the position of Sous Chef at Yacoub’s flagship
    restaurant, Glowbal Grill and Satay bar, he began the intense training of how to own and properly run your own
    restaurant. This learning period spanned 5 years where John worked as Executive Chef, then Food and Beverage Manager and
    eventually as General Manager.
    <br>
    <br>
    Along with his business partner Erik Heck, his goal now is to operate a fun and creative restaurant that celebrates the
    fantastic product available locally and to ultimately offer the same leadership and training all his mentors have given
    him.

      <p class="section__para font12">Erik Heck started his kitchen career as many others do, at home under the support and supervision of his parents, who
    shared their passion for using as many local and organic ingredients as possible with Erik.
    <br>
    <br>
    On graduating from high school Erik made the natural transition by taking a job as a dishwasher at Earls in North
    Vancouver and over the next couple years he moved his way up through the kitchen, culminating in his decision to pursue
    a career in the restaurant industry with a cooking job at Joe Fortes. Erik started as a garde manger, did his
    apprenticeship and within three years moved into a Sous Chef position. It was here that Erik would meet John Crook, who
    was hired as Chef de Cuisine and between Scott Pratico, the chef at the time, and John, Erik was heavily inspired and
    influenced in his approach to great food.
    <br>
    <br>
    When John took the Executive Chef job at Glowbal Grill, Erik soon followed as Executive Sous Chef and continued the
    mentorship. 2 years later Erik was part of the opening team for The Italian Kitchen as Executive Sous Chef under Chef
    Ryan Gauthier. His continued growth of culinary knowledge and leadership skills over his two years at Italian Kitchen
    lead to a promotion back to Glowbal Grill as the Executive Chef.
    <br>
    <br>
    During his tenure at Glowbal Grill, the restaurant was rebranded as a steakhouse under the visionary guidance of Emad
    Yacoub. During his time at Glowbal Collection, Erik had the opportunity to work with a great group of chefs that help
    mould him including Emad, Sean Riley, Ryan Gauthier, Darren Brown, and of course John Crook . All played an integral
    role in his success and contributed to his desire to open his own place. After two years At Glowbal Grill, Erik made the
    decision to partner with John Crook to open up their first venture, The Flying Pig, and the dream became reality.
